          <h2 class="title">Origin Story</h2>
          <p>In past lives I was a career and college readiness instructor, curriculum developer, 
            and advocate for migrant workers, at-risk youth, and homeless populations.</p>

          <p>To make ends meet, however, I found myself working in a medical research labratory
            as a specimen processing specialist, afixing barcodes to vial of saliva all day, 
            every day. Not my life's ambition! </p>

          <p>I've always loved technology and working with computers. I got my start editing Livejournal pages and in college I taught workshops
            teaching students how to build basic webpages. So when I heard about a fullstack JavaScript/Python/Django bootcamp in my area, 
            I studied independentely for five months, then secured a grant through the state of Oregon to attend. </p>

            <p> For four months I studied code every waking hour, working my full time job during the day and attending bootcamp 4 hours in the evening, 5 days per week.
              Nine months after writing my
            first line of code, I secured my first job as a developer!
